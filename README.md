# Notes

To start the app serving the feature flags from a local gen server, launch the 'LiveView App (No-Cluster)' debug configuration in vscode.

To start the app in distributed mode, run the vscode task 'Distributed App'. This will start both the liveview and the feature flags services and enable
service discovery.
